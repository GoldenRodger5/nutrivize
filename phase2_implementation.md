# Meal Plan Phase 2 Implementation

## Overview
Phase 2 extends the meal planning functionality to support multi-day meal plans, with consolidated grocery lists and improved UI navigation.

## Backend Changes

1. **New `generate_meal_plan` Function**
   - Supports generating meal plans for multiple days (1-7)
   - Creates a meal plan with day-specific meals for each requested day
   - Maintains backward compatibility through the original `generate_single_day_meal_plan` function

2. **Grocery List Consolidation**
   - Implemented `generate_consolidated_grocery_list` function that combines ingredients across all days
   - Merges items with the same name and unit, summing their quantities
   - Provides a more user-friendly shopping list

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Improved robustness in `log_meal_from_plan` function
   - Better date handling for food logging
   - More descriptive error messages

## Frontend Changes

1. **Multi-Day Selection**
   - Updated meal plan creation form to allow selecting 1-7 days
   - Removed the "Additional days will be added in Phase 2" comment

2. **Improved Day Navigation**
   - Enhanced day tabs UI with better scrolling behavior
   - Added scrollbar styling for better usability
   - Implemented responsive design for mobile devices

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Improved active day tab appearance with elevation shadow
   - Better visual feedback for completed days

## Testing

Phase 2 implementation was verified with multiple test scripts:
- Basic meal plan generation with multiple days
- Verification of date range in plan name
- Confirmation of grocery list consolidation
- Testing that the UI correctly displays the multi-day plans

## Future Enhancements
For future phases, we could consider:
- Support for meal repetition across days
- Week-by-week meal planning templates
- Advanced grocery list features (estimated costs, store sections)
- Meal leftovers management
