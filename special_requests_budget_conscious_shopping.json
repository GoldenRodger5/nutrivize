Shop seasonal vegetables weekly - onions, tomatoes, and potatoes can be bought in larger quantities. Purchase paneer fresh or make at home to save costs. Greek yogurt can be bought in larger containers. Frozen vegetables like peas are cost-effective and nutritious. Store spices in airtight containers to maintain freshness. Consider buying whole spices and grinding them for better flavor and longer shelf life.",
