# Frontend Build Fix - COMPLETE âœ…

## Build Errors Resolved

The frontend build was failing due to TypeScript compilation errors in `EnhancedMobileFoodLog.tsx`. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. Import Path Correction
**Issue**: `useAppState` import path was incorrect
```typescript
// BEFORE: 
import { useAppState } from '../context/AppStateContext'

// AFTER:
import { useAppState } from '../contexts/AppStateContext'
```

### 2. Unused Variable Cleanup
**Issue**: Unused variables causing TypeScript errors
- Removed unused `loading` variable from useAppState destructuring
- Removed unused `isMobile` variable declaration
- Removed unused `useBreakpointValue` import

### 3. Type Property Corrections
**Issue**: Incorrect property access on typed objects

**Daily Summary Properties:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: 
dailySummary.total_calories
dailySummary.total_protein
dailySummary.total_carbs
dailySummary.total_fat

// AFTER:
dailySummary.total_nutrition.calories
dailySummary.total_nutrition.protein
dailySummary.total_nutrition.carbs
dailySummary.total_nutrition.fat
```

**Goal Properties:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
activeGoal?.daily_calories
activeGoal?.protein_target
activeGoal?.carbs_target
activeGoal?.fat_target

// AFTER:
activeGoal?.nutrition_targets.calories
activeGoal?.nutrition_targets.protein
activeGoal?.nutrition_targets.carbs
activeGoal?.nutrition_targets.fat
```

## Result
