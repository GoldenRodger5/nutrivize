# Test script to demonstrate the comprehensive unit handling improvements

echo "=== Unit Handling Enhancement Test ==="
echo "This test script demonstrates the new unit handling features:"
echo ""

echo "1. âœ… Smart Unit Suggestions:"
echo "   - Food-type-based unit recommendations (e.g., milk â†’ ml/cup, meat â†’ oz/g)"
echo "   - Nutrition label unit preservation (OCR detected units prioritized)"
echo "   - User preference memory (remembers your choices for similar foods)"
echo ""

echo "2. âœ… Enhanced QuantityUnitInput Component:"
echo "   - Real-time unit conversion with visual feedback"
echo "   - Suggested unit badges with star ratings"
echo "   - Tooltips showing unit category explanations"
echo "   - Smart default unit selection based on food type"
echo ""

echo "3. âœ… Consistent Implementation Across All Interfaces:"
echo "   - FoodLogModal: Uses enhanced input with smart suggestions"
echo "   - MealDetailView: Replaced basic Select with smart component"
echo "   - ManualMealPlanner: Existing unit handling preserved"
echo ""

echo "4. âœ… OCR Integration:"
echo "   - Nutrition label serving size and unit detection"
echo "   - Automatic unit defaulting based on OCR results"
echo "   - Preserves original serving information from labels"
echo ""

echo "5. âœ… Unit Memory System:"
echo "   - localStorage-based preference storage"
echo "   - Food-specific unit recommendations improve over time"
echo "   - Frequency-based suggestions (most used units first)"
echo ""

echo "6. âœ… Enhanced Unit Conversion Utilities:"
echo "   - Expanded unit support (weight, volume, pieces)"
echo "   - Smart categorization and compatibility checking"
echo "   - Food-type-specific unit preferences"
echo ""

echo "=== Implementation Details ==="
echo ""
echo "Files Modified:"
echo "- frontend/src/utils/unitConversion.ts (enhanced with smart suggestions)"
echo "- frontend/src/components/QuantityUnitInput.tsx (redesigned with smart features)"
echo "- frontend/src/components/FoodLogModal.tsx (integrated smart defaults)"
echo "- frontend/src/components/MealDetailView.tsx (replaced basic Select)"
echo ""

echo "Key Features Implemented:"
echo "- ðŸŽ¯ Smart unit suggestions based on food type and keywords"
echo "- ðŸ’¾ Unit preference memory system"
echo "- ðŸ”„ Real-time conversion with visual feedback"
echo "- ðŸ“± Nutrition label OCR integration"
echo "- ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced UI with suggestion badges and tooltips"
echo "- ðŸ”§ Consistent implementation across all food interfaces"
echo ""

echo "Test the features by:"
echo "1. Opening the food logging modal"
echo "2. Selecting different food types (see different unit suggestions)"
echo "3. Trying the unit conversion (watch real-time updates)"
echo "4. Using the meal planning interface"
echo "5. Scanning a nutrition label (OCR will detect serving units)"
echo ""

echo "Frontend is running at: http://localhost:5174/"
echo "âœ… All unit handling improvements are complete and ready for testing!"
