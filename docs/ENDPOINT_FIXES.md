# Nutrivize API Endpoint Fixes

## Duplicate Endpoint Fixes - July 3, 2025

### Fixed Issues:

1. **AI Health Score Duplicate Endpoints**
   - Problem: Both `ai_dashboard.py` and `ai_health.py` had a `/health-score` endpoint
   - Solution: Renamed endpoint in `ai_health.py` to `/user-health-score`
   - Original files preserved as `ai_health_original.py`

2. **Analytics Route Consolidation**
   - Problem: Multiple analytics route files with duplicate endpoints
   - Solution: Consolidated to use the most updated version (`analytics_fixed.py`)
   - Original files preserved as `analytics_original.py`

3. **Meal Planning & AI Overlap**
   - Note: The `/ai/meal-plan` and `/meal-planning/generate-plan` endpoints are similar but not exact duplicates.
   - They serve different client needs with different request/response models.

### ShoppingListItemUpdateRequest:
- No changes needed - the model correctly omits `item_id` since it's provided in the URL path

### Next Steps:
- Test all endpoints to ensure they're functioning correctly
- Consider further consolidation of similar functionality
- Review frontend code to ensure it's using the correct endpoints
