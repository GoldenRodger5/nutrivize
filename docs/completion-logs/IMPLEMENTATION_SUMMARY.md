# Nutrivize V2 Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Meal Plan Storage with Versioning ✅
- **Implemented**: Full CRUD operations for meal plans with version control
- **Features**:
  - Each meal plan can have multiple versions
  - `is_current_version` flag to track the latest version
  - `version` number increments automatically
  - New endpoints for version management:
    - `GET /meal-planning/plans/{plan_id}/versions` - Get all versions
    - `POST /meal-planning/plans/{plan_id}/save-version` - Save new version

### 2. Shopping List Generation ✅
- **Implemented**: Per meal plan shopping list generation with AI-powered pricing
- **Features**:
  - Ingredient aggregation across all meals in a plan
  - AI-powered pricing using Anthropic Claude for New England pricing estimates
  - Categorized shopping lists (Proteins, Vegetables, Fruits, etc.)
  - Store package size and reasoning included
  - Fallback pricing system if AI fails
  - Endpoint: `POST /meal-planning/plans/{plan_id}/shopping-list`

### 3. Enhanced AI Integration ✅
- **Implemented**: Robust integration of user preferences and active goals with AI
- **Features**:
  - AI meal suggestions now consider active goal context
  - Goal-specific recommendations (weight loss, muscle gain, etc.)
  - Enhanced prompts include dietary preferences, cooking skill level, prep time
  - User context gathering from preferences and active goals
  - Updated endpoint: `POST /ai/meal-suggestions` (now passes user_id for context)

### 4. Single Active Goal Enforcement ✅
- **Implemented**: Only one goal can be active at a time
- **Features**:
  - Automatic deactivation of other goals when setting a new active goal
  - `activate_goal()` method for switching active goals
  - Goal context for AI with specific focus areas per goal type
  - New methods:
    - `get_active_goal_nutrition_targets()` - Get nutrition targets from active goal
    - `get_active_goal_preferences()` - Get goal context for AI
    - `_get_goal_context_for_ai()` - Goal-specific recommendations

### 5. Goal Integration Throughout App ✅
- **Implemented**: Active goal attributes considered in all features
- **Features**:
  - Food logging now shows goal progress: `GET /food-logs/daily/{date}/with-goals`
  - Meal planning uses active goal nutrition targets if not explicitly provided
  - AI suggestions tailored to active goal type
  - Progress tracking with remaining calories, protein, carbs, fat
  - Percentage completion towards daily goals

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
- **Meal Plans**: Added `version`, `is_current_version`, `parent_version` fields
- **Shopping Lists**: Enhanced with AI pricing data structure
- **Indexes**: Added compound indexes for efficient version queries

### AI-Powered Pricing System
- Replaced static pricing database with AI-powered estimates
- Uses Anthropic Claude with New England grocery store context
- Includes reasoning and package size information
- Fallback system for reliability

### Goal Context System
- Different goal types have specific AI contexts:
  - **Weight Loss**: Focus on satiety, high-protein foods
  - **Weight Gain**: Emphasize calorie-dense, nutritious foods
  - **Muscle Gain**: Protein optimization, post-workout nutrition
  - **Maintenance**: Balanced nutrition and variety
  - **General Health**: Whole foods, micronutrient density

### Enhanced User Context
- AI now considers:
  - Active goal type and targets
  - Dietary preferences and restrictions
  - Cooking skill level and prep time preferences
  - Previous meal history for variety
  - Allergens and dislikes

## New API Endpoints

1. `GET /food-logs/daily/{date}/with-goals` - Daily logs with goal progress
2. `GET /meal-planning/plans/{plan_id}/versions` - Get meal plan versions
3. `POST /meal-planning/plans/{plan_id}/save-version` - Save new plan version
4. `POST /meal-planning/plans/{plan_id}/shopping-list` - Generate shopping list
5. `GET /meal-planning/shopping-lists` - Get user's shopping lists

## Testing

- Updated `test_auth_complete.py` with new endpoint tests
- All services load successfully
- Enhanced meal suggestions work with user context
- Goal progress tracking functional

## Configuration Requirements

- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Required for AI pricing and enhanced suggestions
  - `MONGODB_URL` - MongoDB connection
  - Firebase configuration for authentication

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Performance Optimization**: Cache AI pricing responses
2. **Error Handling**: Add retry logic for AI failures
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limits for AI calls
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging for AI pricing accuracy
5. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on pricing estimates for improvement

All requested features have been fully implemented and tested. The system now provides:
- ✅ Versioned meal plan storage
- ✅ Per meal plan shopping lists with AI pricing
- ✅ Robust AI integration with preferences and goals
- ✅ Single active goal enforcement
- ✅ Goal attributes integrated throughout all features
