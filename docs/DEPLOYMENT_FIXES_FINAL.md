## Verification Steps

1. Fixed code indentation and syntax errors
2. Created verification scripts to test the deployment
3. Created comprehensive testing for all affected endpoints

## Deployment Instructions

1. Run the fix and deploy script:
   ```
   ./fix_and_deploy_final.sh
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Fix indentation issues in the code
   - Commit and push changes to the repository
   - Wait for Render to deploy the changes
   - Run verification tests to confirm the fixes worked

## Expected Results

After deployment, the following should work properly:
- All analytics endpoints should return proper responses (no more 422 errors)
- AI chat should be able to access food index data
- Smart Meal Planning should work correctly

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after deployment:
- Check Render logs for any new errors
