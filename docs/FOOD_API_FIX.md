# Food API Fix: Summary of Changes

## Issue Identified
When accessing the Food Index in the production environment, the frontend was receiving a 405 (Method Not Allowed) error for the `/foods` endpoint. This occurred when making a GET request to:
```
GET /foods?limit=21&skip=0&sort_by=name&sort_order=asc
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The backend API had **two duplicate GET handlers** for the `/foods` path in `backend/app/routes/foods.py`.
2. The first endpoint used the `list_food_items` method which only returns the user's personal foods.
3. The second endpoint used the `get_foods` method which correctly returns both the user's personal foods and general foods.
4. This duplication was causing a conflict that resulted in a 405 error.

## Fix Implemented
1. **Removed the duplicate GET endpoint** for `/foods` that used `list_food_items`.
2. **Enhanced the remaining endpoint** to:
   - Support filtering via the `filter_query` parameter
   - Use the correct data separation pattern with the `get_foods` method
   - Properly handle sorting and pagination

## Data Separation Security
The fix ensures proper data separation by:
- Using the query `{"$or": [{"user_id": user_id}, {"user_id": None}]}` to fetch only:
  - The logged-in user's own foods
  - General foods (where `user_id` is `None`)
- Never exposing another user's private food items

## Testing
A test script (`test_food_api.py`) was created to verify:
- The `/foods` endpoint returns a 200 status code
- The correct food items are returned
- Pagination and sorting work as expected

## Deployment
The fix has been deployed to Render and can be verified by:
1. Logging into the Nutrivize app
2. Navigating to the Food Index page
3. Confirming that food items are displayed correctly

## Follow-up Items
- Monitor the `/foods` endpoint for any performance issues with large datasets
- Consider adding caching for frequently accessed food items
- Evaluate if additional filtering options would improve user experience
