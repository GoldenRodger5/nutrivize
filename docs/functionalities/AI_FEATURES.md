#### **Real-World Example**
```typescript
// Morning Dashboard View
const morningInsights = {
  message: "Good morning! You're starting the day strong with 82% of yesterday's goals met.",
  recommendations: [
    "Consider a protein-rich breakfast to maintain muscle synthesis",
    "Your iron levels have been low this week - try spinach or lean red meat",
    "Hydration was excellent yesterday - keep it up!"
  ],
  quickActions: [
    { type: "log_breakfast", suggestion: "Greek yogurt with berries (based on your preferences)" },
    { type: "water_reminder", target: "16oz in the next hour" },

‚úÖ Protein: 142g/120g (118% - excellent for muscle maintenance)
‚ö†Ô∏è Fiber: 18g/25g (72% - room for improvement)
‚ùå Sodium: 2,890mg/2,300mg (126% - a bit high)

Highlights:
- Great protein distribution throughout the day
- Loved that you had salmon for dinner - omega-3s were on point!
- Vegetables could use a boost - try adding spinach to your morning smoothie

Quick improvement: Swap your afternoon crackers for an apple. You'll get 4g more fiber and reduce sodium by 200mg!"

Attachments: [Detailed nutrition chart, fiber-rich snack suggestions]
```

#### **Meal Planning Request**
```
User: "I need a quick dinner idea. I have chicken breast and not much time."

AI Response: "Perfect! Based on your preferences and the fact that you're 15g short on protein today, here's a 20-minute winner:

üçó Garlic Herb Chicken with Quick Quinoa

Why it's perfect for you:
- 35g protein (gets you to your daily goal!)
- Uses your chicken breast
- Ready in 18 minutes
- Fits your Mediterranean preferences

Would you like the full recipe, or should I suggest sides to complete your macros?"

2. **Goal Setting**: Understand which areas need improvement
3. **Progress Tracking**: See how lifestyle changes impact health
4. **Motivation**: Gamified health improvement with clear metrics

### **How It Works**

#### **Multi-Factor Analysis**
The health score considers six key dimensions:

1. **Nutrition Balance (40% weight)**
   - Macro distribution vs. recommendations
   - Micronutrient adequacy
   - Calorie balance

2. **Goal Adherence (25% weight)**
   - Consistency with set nutrition goals
   - Progress toward weight/fitness targets
   - Meal timing adherence

3. **Food Quality (15% weight)**
   - Whole food vs. processed food ratio
   - Dietary diversity
   - Nutrient density of choices

4. **Consistency (10% weight)**
   - Regular logging habits
   - Meal frequency patterns
   - Sleep-nutrition timing

5. **Hydration (5% weight)**
   - Daily water intake vs. needs
   - Timing of hydration

6. **Lifestyle Integration (5% weight)**
   - Meal timing with activity
   - Social eating patterns
   - Stress eating indicators

### **Real-World Examples**

#### **High Score (85-100): "Excellent"**
```typescript
const excellentHealthProfile = {
  score: 92,
  message: "Outstanding nutrition habits! You're in the top 10% of users.",
  strengths: [
    "Consistent macro balance for 14 days straight",
    "Excellent micronutrient diversity",
    "Perfect meal timing with your workout schedule",
    "Great hydration habits"
  ],
  improvements: [
    "Consider adding more omega-3 rich foods 2x per week",
    "Your weekend fiber intake dips slightly - plan ahead"
  ],
  motivation: "You're setting an amazing example! Keep this momentum."
}
```

#### **Moderate Score (60-84): "Good Progress"**
```typescript
const goodHealthProfile = {
  score: 74,
  message: "You're making solid progress with room for optimization.",
  strengths: [
    "Protein goals consistently met",
    "Good food logging consistency",
    "Improved vegetable intake this month"
  ],
  improvements: [
    "Sodium intake is 40% above recommended levels",
    "Try to add 2 more servings of fruits daily",
    "Consider meal prep to improve weekend nutrition"
  ],
  actionPlan: [
    "Week 1: Focus on reducing processed foods",
    "Week 2: Add a fruit to breakfast and lunch",
    "Week 3: Prep healthy weekend meals"
  ]
}
```

```python
class EnhancedHealthScoreCalculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weights = {
            'nutrition_balance': 0.40,
            'goal_adherence': 0.25,
            'food_quality': 0.15,
            'consistency': 0.10,
            'hydration': 0.05,
            'lifestyle': 0.05
        }
    
    def calculate_nutrition_balance(self, logs: List[FoodLog]) -> float:
        """Calculate nutrition balance score (0-100)"""
        recent_logs = logs[-7:]  # Last 7 days
        
        # Macro balance analysis
        macro_score = self._analyze_macro_distribution(recent_logs)
        
        # Micronutrient adequacy
        micro_score = self._analyze_micronutrients(recent_logs)
        
        # Calorie consistency
        calorie_score = self._analyze_calorie_consistency(recent_logs)
        
        return (macro_score * 0.4 + micro_score * 0.4 + calorie_score * 0.2)
    
    def calculate_food_quality(self, logs: List[FoodLog]) -> float:
        """Assess food quality and diversity"""
        # Processed vs whole food ratio
        processing_score = self._analyze_food_processing(logs)
        
        # Food diversity (unique foods per week)
        diversity_score = self._analyze_food_diversity(logs)
        
        # Nutrient density
        density_score = self._analyze_nutrient_density(logs)
        
        return (processing_score + diversity_score + density_score) / 3
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **AI Service Architecture**
```python
class AIServiceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.claude_client = AnthropicClient()
        self.context_manager = UserContextManager()
        self.cache = AIResponseCache()
    
    async def get_contextualized_response(
        self, 
        query: str, 
        user_id: str, 
        response_type: str
    ) -> AIResponse:
        # Build comprehensive user context
        context = await self.context_manager.build_context(user_id)
        
        # Check cache for similar queries
        cached_response = await self.cache.get_cached_response(query, context.hash())
        if cached_response and cached_response.is_valid():
            return cached_response
        
        # Generate new AI response
        response = await self._generate_ai_response(query, context, response_type)
        
        # Cache for future use
        await self.cache.store_response(query, context.hash(), response)
        
        return response
```

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Response Caching**: Cache similar queries to reduce API calls
- **Context Compression**: Efficient user context summarization
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple AI requests when possible
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time response delivery for chat interface
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI service is unavailable

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Response Validation**: Ensure AI responses are accurate and helpful
- **Safety Filters**: Remove potentially harmful or incorrect nutrition advice
- **Consistency Checks**: Maintain consistent recommendations across features
- **User Feedback Integration**: Learn from user ratings and corrections
