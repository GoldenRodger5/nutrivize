# Food Logging Modal and UI Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Modal Stacking Issues
- **Problem**: When clicking "Log Weight" or "Log Water", the Today's Nutrition modal opened behind other modals
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper z-index management to all modals
  - TodaysNutritionDetailModal: z-index 1400/1500 (highest)
  - FoodLogModal, WaterLogModal, WeightLogModal: z-index 1200/1300
  - Modified handlers to close other modals when opening new ones

### 2. Log Food Button Navigation Issue
- **Problem**: "Log Food" button was navigating to food log page instead of opening a modal
- **Solution**: 
  - Created new `FoodLogModal.tsx` component with rich functionality
  - Modified `handleLogFood()` to open modal instead of navigating
  - Added proper modal state management with `useDisclosure`

### 3. Food Log Modal Functionality
- **Problem**: Food log form wasn't showing scrollable foods, recent foods, and only showed one popular food
- **Solution**: 
  - Created comprehensive FoodLogModal with:
    - Search functionality with live results
    - Tabbed interface for Recent/Popular/My Foods
    - Scrollable food lists with proper styling
    - Multiple food categories properly displayed
    - Rich nutrition preview
    - Proper food selection with visual feedback

### 4. API 405 Method Errors
- **Problem**: `/food-logs/?date=2025-07-02` was returning 405 Method Not Allowed
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed API endpoint in `useTodayActivity.ts` from `/food-logs/?date=${today}` to `/food-logs/daily/${today}`
  - Updated response handling to match backend structure (DailyNutritionSummary.meals array)
