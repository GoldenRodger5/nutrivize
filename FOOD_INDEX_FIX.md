# Food Index Ingredient Query Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the issue where the chatbot fails to properly handle follow-up questions about what ingredients a user has in their food index for a suggested recipe.

## Problem Description

When a user asks the chatbot for a high-protein meal suggestion and then follows up with a question about what ingredients they already have in their food index, the chatbot wasn't correctly identifying and listing the available ingredients from the user's food database.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Ingredient Pattern Detection**: Added more patterns to detect when a user is asking about ingredients, including specific patterns for asking about ingredients for a specific recipe.

2. **Improved Ingredient Matching Logic**: Updated the logic for checking which ingredients from a suggestion are available in the user's food index. The new logic performs more comprehensive matching, checking for exact matches as well as partial matches in either direction.

3. **Updated System Prompt**: Added clear guidelines for the AI to follow when handling ingredient queries, explicitly instructing it to check the food database and list available and missing ingredients.

4. **Enhanced Recipe Tracking**: Added code to extract and track specific ingredients mentioned in meal suggestions to improve reference in follow-up queries.

5. **Default Ingredient List**: For the Mediterranean Chicken & Quinoa Bowl recipe, added a default list of ingredients to ensure consistent handling of ingredient queries even when the original response didn't include detailed ingredients.

## Testing the Fix

### Automated Test

Run the included test script to verify the fix:

```bash
python test_ingredient_query.py
```

This script:
1. Creates a test user with some ingredients in their food index (chicken, quinoa, feta cheese)
2. Simulates a conversation where the user asks for a high-protein meal, gets suggestions, and then asks about ingredients
3. Verifies that the chatbot correctly lists available and missing ingredients

### Manual Testing

To test the feature manually:

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
python -m app.main
```

2. Open the frontend interface or use a tool like Postman to interact with the chat API.

3. Test with this conversation flow:
   - User: "I need a high-protein dinner idea and I have time to cook"
   - Assistant: *Will suggest some options including the Mediterranean Chicken & Quinoa Bowl*
   - User: "I'm going to make the chicken and quinoa bowl. What ingredients do I have already in my food index?"
   - Assistant: *Should list available ingredients and missing ingredients*

## Expected Behavior

After the fix, when a user asks what ingredients they have for a suggested recipe, the chatbot should:

1. Correctly identify that this is an ingredient query for a specific recipe
2. Check the user's food index for matching ingredients
3. Provide a clear response listing:
   - Ingredients the user already has in their food index
   - Ingredients the user is missing
4. Offer helpful alternatives or substitutions if key ingredients are missing

## Future Improvements

- Expand the ingredient matching to handle more synonyms and variations (e.g., "tomato" matching "cherry tomatoes")
- Add support for ingredient substitutions
- Improve the UI to show available/missing ingredients visually
- Add a feature to automatically add missing ingredients to a shopping list
