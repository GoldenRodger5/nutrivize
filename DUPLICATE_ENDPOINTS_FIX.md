# Duplicate Endpoints Fix

This document outlines the duplicate endpoints issues found in the Nutrivize v2 project and their fixes.

## Issues Found

### 1. AI Health Score Duplicate Endpoint
- **Issue**: Both `/ai-dashboard/health-score` and `/ai-health/health-score` routes exist
- **Fix**: Renamed `/ai-health/health-score` to `/ai-health/health-score-analysis`
- **Files Modified**: `backend/app/routes/ai_health.py`
- **Status**: Fixed

### 2. Analytics Files Duplication
- **Issue**: Multiple analytics files exist (`analytics.py`, `analytics_fixed.py`, and `analytics_hotfix.py`) with duplicate endpoints
- **Current Handling**: The application's `main.py` is designed to handle this by only importing one of these files based on a fallback mechanism
- **Recommendation**: Consider consolidating these files or adding clear documentation about which one is active
- **Status**: Not an active issue, handled by import logic

### 3. Similar Meal Plan Endpoints in Different Routes
- **Issue**: `/ai/meal-plan` and `/meal-planning/generate-plan` endpoints have similar functionality but different parameter structures
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate these endpoints or document their different purposes clearly
- **Status**: Not a critical issue as they have different paths and parameter structures

### 4. Shopping List Item Update Request
- **Issue**: Previously had an unnecessary `item_id` required field which caused 422 errors
- **Status**: Already fixed - the `item_id` parameter is correctly provided in the URL path instead of the request body

## Summary of Changes

1. Renamed `/ai-health/health-score` endpoint to `/ai-health/health-score-analysis` to prevent route conflicts
2. Created this documentation file to track endpoint issues

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Endpoint Naming Conventions**: Establish clear naming conventions for endpoints to prevent conflicts
2. **Route Auditing**: Periodically audit routes to identify and resolve potential conflicts
3. **API Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive API documentation to clearly identify the purpose of each endpoint
4. **Code Consolidation**: Consider consolidating similar functionality in different routes to reduce duplication
