## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

Nutrivize employs a multi-component architecture:

1.  **React Frontend:** Provides the primary user interface, handles user interactions, and communicates with the backend API layer. It uses Firebase for client-side authentication.
2.  **Python/FastAPI Backend:** The core engine of Nutrivize. It manages business logic, database operations (MongoDB), integrates with external AI services (Anthropic, Google Vision), verifies Firebase authentication tokens, and serves data to the frontend and iOS app.
3.  **Swift iOS App:** Acts as a companion app, primarily responsible for gathering health data from Apple HealthKit and securely transmitting it to the Python backend. It also interacts with the backend for user authentication and other app-specific features.
4.  **Node.js Mock Servers:** Currently, `api-server.js` (and `backend/src/index.js`) provide mock API endpoints. In a typical production flow, the frontend would primarily interact with a robust API gateway or directly with the FastAPI backend, with `api-server.js` potentially evolving into such a gateway that routes requests and handles initial Firebase interactions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

(Detailed setup instructions should be reviewed and updated based on the final deployment strategy for the multiple backend components. The existing setup guide provides a starting point.)

**General Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js and npm
*   Python and pip
*   MongoDB instance (local or cloud)
*   Firebase project setup
*   API keys for Google Cloud Vision and Anthropic

**Basic Local Setup (Conceptual):**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd nutrivize
    ```

2.  **Backend (Python/FastAPI - `backend/app/`):**
    *   Navigate to `backend/`: `cd backend`
    *   Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Configure environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file in `backend/` or `backend/app/`) for database connection, Firebase Admin SDK credentials, Anthropic API key, Google Cloud Vision API key.
    *   Run the FastAPI server (typically from within `backend/app/` or via a script in `backend/`):
        ```bash
        # Example: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080 (adjust command as per project setup)
        ```

3.  **Frontend (React - `frontend/`):**
    *   Navigate to `frontend/`: `cd frontend` (from root)
    *   Install dependencies: `npm install`
    *   Configure environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file) for the backend API URL (pointing to the FastAPI server or the `api-server.js` if used as a proxy/mock) and Firebase client SDK config.
    *   Start the development server: `npm run dev` (or `npm start`)

4.  **Node.js Mock Server (`api-server.js` - Optional, for current mock functionality):**
    *   From the root directory:
    *   If not already done by the root `install:all` script, ensure dependencies listed in the root `package.json` related to `api-server.js` are met (Express, CORS).
    *   Run: `node api-server.js` (or `npm run api` as defined in root `package.json`)

5.  **iOS App (`swift/`):**
    *   Open the project in Xcode.
    *   Configure API endpoints in `NutrivizeAPIClient.swift` to point to your running backend.
    *   Build and run on a simulator or physical device.

*(Note: The co-existence of multiple servers writing to `backend/port.txt` and multiple `package.json` files suggests careful attention to port management and startup scripts for a seamless development experience.)*
