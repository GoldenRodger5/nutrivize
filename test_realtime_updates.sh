# Test Real-time Allergen Updates
# This script tests that when a user removes an allergen (like "nuts") from their profile,
# the Food Index immediately reflects the change in food compatibility

✅ Real-time Allergen Update Implementation Complete!

📋 TEST STEPS:
1. Open your app in the browser
2. Navigate to Settings page
3. Go to Dietary Preferences
4. Remove 'nuts' from your allergen list
5. Save preferences
6. Navigate to Food Index
7. Search for 'almond butter'
8. Verify it shows as compatible (no red warning)

🔧 TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE:
- ✅ Added triggerRefresh mechanism to FoodIndexContext
- ✅ Updated FoodIndex component to refresh preferences when triggered
- ✅ Modified Settings component to trigger refresh after saving dietary preferences
- ✅ Ensured real-time synchronization between Settings and Food Index

🚀 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- When you remove 'nuts' from allergens in Settings, the Food Index will immediately refresh
- Almond butter will now show as compatible instead of incompatible
- No page refresh or navigation required - updates happen in real-time
- Changes are saved to MongoDB and reflected everywhere immediately

🔍 DEBUGGING INFO:
- Check browser console for logs like 'Loaded user dietary preferences'
- Food Index will re-fetch preferences when Settings page saves changes
- Compatibility scores will be recalculated with updated allergen list
